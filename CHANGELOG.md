# Changelog

All notable changes to GEA-Program, newest first. Each released section is
headed by its tag and date; `ship.ps1` refuses to ship a tag that has no
section here. The long-form record, by layer, is `docs/HISTORY.md`; the
session-by-session working record is `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-10-01 - the dashboard as the door, and the patch panel

### Added
- The dashboard as the door: `gea/workspace.py`, `gea/jobs.py`,
  `gea/service.py`, `gea/web/app.html`; CLI `gea workspace`, `gea serve`,
  `gea users`, `gea survey`. See README "Serving the dashboard".
- Acceptance section AC (17 checks; gate 189); section AC in the FAT/SAT
  protocol; a browser-driven check of the page.
- The patch panel: `gea/wits0.py` (WITS Level 0 over TCP connect, TCP
  listen, serial; in-package simulator `gea wits0-sim`), `gea/witsml.py`
  (WITSML 1.4.1 read-only client; in-package test store), `gea/patches.py`
  (supervised patches with reconnect, heartbeat, daily record files, priority
  fold), unit normalisation on mappings (`unit_in`), the patch API and the
  Patch panel page. Extras `serial`; `live` now includes pyserial.
  Acceptance section AD (10 checks; gate 199).

### Changed
- `gea/alarm_engine.py`: processing is idempotent against the event log
  (states rebuilt from the log, samples before the watermark skipped);
  acknowledgements persist across runs; KPIs no longer double on re-runs.
- `gea/client_reports.py`: the alarm report reads the engine's event list
  (run markers never appear in a report).
- `pyproject.toml`: `web/*` is package data; `serial` extra.
- `gea/dashboard.py`: a stream with no downhole gauge stations (a drill-floor
  feed) gets quality and alarm reports; its drift report is marked not
  applicable instead of failing the refresh.
- `gea/sbom.py`: pyserial listed among the optional components (ten in all).
- README, TESTER_GUIDE: the served dashboard.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-09-30 - the standalone ship

### Added
- `gea/opcua_port.py`: read-only OPC UA client (asyncua, optional) - read
  once or subscribe; StatusCode severity -> GOOD / STALE / GAP; source,
  server or arrival timestamp; Basic256Sha256 when a certificate and key are
  given; credentials by environment-variable name only; recording + replay.
- `gea/mqtt_port.py`: MQTT subscriber (paho-mqtt v2, optional) - MQTT
  3.1.1 / 5, TLS, QoS per topic, `+` / `#` wildcards; number, JSON
  (value / time / quality paths) and Sparkplug B payloads with a
  dependency-free Sparkplug codec and alias learning from any NBIRTH / DBIRTH;
  recording + replay.
- `gea/live_ports.py`: what every live port shares - the client-owned tag
  map (an empty map is declined), record creation with source and ingest
  timestamps, records -> time-indexed stream, hand-off to the
  store-and-forward buffer, JSON-lines recording and replay, summary.
- CLI `gea opcua` and `gea mqtt` (`--config`, `--write-example-config`,
  `--replay`, `--record`, `--seconds`, `--read-once`, `--out`,
  `--stream-csv`); a missing dependency or an unreachable server is one
  line, not a traceback.
- Extras `opcua`, `mqtt`, `live` (all three live ports) and `xls`
  (`xlrd`, which `read_drift_xls` imported without declaring it).
- `docs/examples/opcua_config.json`, `docs/examples/mqtt_config.json`.
- Acceptance section AB (AB1-AB14): Sparkplug round trip, quality mapping,
  alias learning, number / JSON payloads and wildcards, recording -> replay
  -> stream -> buffer, OPC UA status mapping and replay latency, registry
  status, empty-map refusal, CLI replay and stream CSV round trip; a live
  in-process OPC UA server loopback wherever asyncua is installed. Section
  AB is part of the FAT/SAT protocol.
- `tools/standalone_check.py`: the self-contained guard (imports, text,
  metadata), run by CI, by `ship.ps1` and by `pytest`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) and `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`.

### Changed
- The package is standalone. Every docstring, comment, check message,
  catalogue provenance note and document is in the program's own words;
  no tracked file names another program, its modules, paper numbers, version
  chains or design-thread handles. Two result keys renamed for consistency:
  blind-harness `doctrine` -> `method`; classifier candidate `landmark_rho`
  -> `anchor_rho`. Function names and every computed value are unchanged
  (48 of 52 modules identical in code structure; the outputs of quickstart,
  survey, client reports, model cards and the dashboard match the previous
  tree number for number).
- `docs/HISTORY.md` restarted at v0.1.0 as GEA-Program's own record.
- `docs/commercial/*` rewritten for the MPL-2.0 licence (they described a
  dual AGPL/commercial licence that never applied to this package) and for
  the current gate and port list.
- `README.md`: "Basis" replaces the lineage section; "Live data" section;
  layout updated.
- `gea/sbom.py`: optional components now list asyncua, paho-mqtt, pymodbus
  and xlrd; the SBOM has nine components.
- `gea/fat_sat.py`: client sections A, C, F, AA, AB.
- `ship.ps1`: step 4 runs the standalone check as a gate; step 5 requires a
  CHANGELOG section for the tag.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: runs the standalone check.
- `.gitignore`: `/_transport/`, `/_to_delete/`.

### Removed
- The import machinery that produced v0.1.0: the importer script under
  `tools/`, its per-file record under `gea/`, the audit that measured what
  the import left behind, and `tools/native/`. Nothing flows in automatically
  any more; future work is built here.

### Verification
- `gea accept` 172/172 in the repository and from the installed wheel in an
  empty virtual environment holding only numpy; the live OPC UA loopback ran
  on the development machine (asyncua 2.0.1, paho-mqtt 2.1.0).
- `tools/standalone_check.py`: 0 findings.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-09-29 - first ship

The downhole gauge program as its own package: 49 modules under `gea/`, the
52-entry public archive catalogue with a provenance file per entry, the `gea`
front door and the desktop window, the tester guide, the requirements matrix
and the commercial documents. Licence MPL-2.0. Acceptance 157/157.
